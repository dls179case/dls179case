    "text": "Research in the Yang Lab at Cornell University\nIn the Yang Lab at Cornell University’s Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, under the guidance of PI Rong Yang, PhD, I advanced nanomedicine through two key projects. From 2019 to 2020, I focused on an antibiotic-free treatment for otitis media using an engineered hydrogel, where I drafted the IACUC animal protocol for chinchilla models, conducted general animal care, infection procedures, surgeries, and dissections, trained team members on these techniques, and cultured bacteria for infections. This effort, which earned me the Engineering Learning Initiatives Undergraduate Research Award, culminated in a co-authored publication in Nano Today. From 2020 to 2023, I pioneered a rapid, template- and solvent-free method for synthesizing aspherical polymer nanodomes via condensed droplet polymerization in a chemical vapor deposition chamber, including developing techniques to incorporate therapeutic drugs into the nanoparticle matrix without solvents. This work resulted in a second-author manuscript in Chemistry of Materials, a patent on polymer nanoparticles via condensed droplet polymerization and solvent-free incorporation of therapeutic molecules, and recognition through the Hunter R. Rawlings III Cornell Presidential Research Scholar Award. I also received training in the Nanoscale Facility clean room for electron beam lithography.\n\nView the tutorial for this template (+ download link)"

    "text": "LinkedIn\n  \n  \n    \n     Email\n  \n\n\n\n\nWelcome to my website!\nDanielle Streever is a second-year MD/PhD candidate in the Medical Scientist Training Program at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, where she is pursuing a Doctor of Medicine (expected 2031) and a Doctor of Philosophy in Biomedical Engineering (expected 2029). Originally from Atlanta, Georgia, Danielle’s journey into biomedical engineering began at Cornell University, where she earned a Bachelor of Science in the field in 2022, followed by a Master of Engineering in 2023. Her academic path reflects a deep commitment to translating innovative engineering principles into clinical solutions, fueled by a passion for nanomedicine and its potential to address complex immunological and epigenetic challenges in patient care.\nWith roots in both the arts and sciences—having trained and performed with Ballet Chicago post-high school—Danielle brings a uniquely interdisciplinary perspective to her work. Her research trajectory spans solvent-free nanoparticle synthesis, drug encapsulation techniques, and high-throughput sequencing applications, honed through roles at Cornell’s Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering Department under PI Rong Yang and currently in the Maiseyeu Lab at Case Western. Key contributions include developing rapid methods for aspherical polymer nanodomes, authoring manuscripts on antiseptic delivery for otitis media, and optimizing nanoparticle libraries for DNA barcoding in vitro. Currently, under PI Andrei Maiseyeu, she is advancing a polymer nanoparticle library for barcoded high-throughput sequencing, optimizing Southern Blots for DNA glycosylation assays, and testing nanoparticle uptake in bone marrow-derived macrophages, further pushing the boundaries of nanomedicine for epigenetic and immunological applications. These efforts, recognized with awards like the Hunter R. Rawlings III Cornell Presidential Research Scholar and the Engineering Learning Initiatives Undergraduate Research Award, underscore her drive to innovate at the intersection of nanotechnology and personalized medicine.\nBeyond the lab, she is deeply engaged in teaching, leadership, and community service. As a Graduate Teaching Assistant at Cornell for courses in Biomedical Transport Phenomena and Molecular Principles of Biomedical Engineering, she mentored students through lectures, labs, and project guidance. In leadership roles at Case Western, she served as MSTP Retreat Chair for two years, CMDA Medical School Branch Leader, and M1 Social Chair at Case Western, fostering collaborative environments for aspiring physician-scientists. When not immersed in science, you’ll find her composing music on violin, dancing, or scaling rock walls.\nPlease feel free to contact me if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential projects.\n\nView the tutorial for this template (+ download link)"
